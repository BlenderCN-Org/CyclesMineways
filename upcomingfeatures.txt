Animated textures (defaults from minecraft, also: grass, leaves, torches)
Clouds (3d and 2d)
Better lighting based on time of day
Varying lighting intensity for different blocks (for example: torches are darker than glowstone)
Support for different weather types
Builtin fire (Including optional ember particles (both real and minecraft-like (minecraft-like by default)))
Restructure block metadata so it uses 2d array
Lower noise lighting (using invisible light emitters that only show on diffuse rays)
Increase diffuse on normal block textures (need to do a litle research on this beforehand)
Remove the need for the PREFIX constant to be manual (This -should- be possible)
Colored glass uses its color for transparency

-- For when we have nothing else to do --
"Real" fire using inbuilt fire engine (optional, default off)
"Real" tall grass using inbuilt fire engine (optional, default off)
"Real" low grass on grass (dirt) blocks (optional, default off)
Glass that is physically accurate (optional, default off, creates more noise)
