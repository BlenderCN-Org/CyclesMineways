Varying lighting intensity for different blocks (for example: torches are darker than glowstone)
Better lighting based on time of day (including background light getting brighter during mid day)
Sprites for sun and moon
  Requires access to texture files that aren't currently provided
Restructuring block metadata
  Large amounts of work
  Proper data structure needs to be better defined
    Arrays vs. objects vs. dictionaries, etc.
    What best suits legibility, extensibility, and features?
  Massively alters codebase
Lower noise lighting (using invisible light emitters that only show on diffuse rays)
  Difficult to figure out what the issue is
  Might require using geometry
Colored glass uses its color for transparency
  Requires metadata not passed by Mineways currently
Support for connected textures
  Requires texture files not currently passed by Mineways
Clouds (2D and 3D)
  Difficult to understand and write
  Might require changing geometry
Animated textures (defaults from Minecraft as provided by the resource pack, also: grass, leaves, torches)
  Difficult to structure
  Requires access to animated texture files which isn't currently provided
  Requires scripting of parts of the engine not yet explored (timeline)
Support for different weather types
  Difficult to understand and write
  Might require scripting of parts of the engine not yet explored (physics, particles, timeline)
Better fire including embers, in the spirit of both Minecraft and real fire using the builtin engine
  Difficult to understand and write
  Might require changing geometry
  Requires scripting of parts of the engine not yet explored (physics, particles, timeline)
Better grass using inbuilt hair engine
Importing other models (such as characters and mobs)
  Requires large amounts of information not currently conveyed by Mineways
