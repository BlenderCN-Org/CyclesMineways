Varying lighting intensity for different blocks (for example: glowstone is brighter than torches)
Better lighting based on time of day
  background light brightest during mid day
  background light darkest during mid night
  night time stars are currently static, this looks very weird in an animation where the camera moves
Sprites for sun and moon
  Requires access to texture files that aren't currently provided
  The scipt could just use a 2d circle, make it super bright and far away
    As you can't see any texture on real sun from earth, this will look real, but not minecrafty 
Restructuring block metadata
  Large amounts of work
  Proper data structure needs to be better defined
    Arrays vs. objects vs. dictionaries, etc.
    What best suits legibility, extensibility, and features?
  Massively alters codebase
  Needs to take into account that different materials have different fresnel values
    do note: all materials in the real world have fresnel, not just shiney ones
Lower noise lighting (using invisible light emitters that only show on diffuse rays)
  On light blocks that do not take up the entire block space:
     Need to use invisible light emitters that only show in shadows
  Requires knowledge of how Cycles works and how to reduce noise
    one massive factor in noise, is using mix nodes set to values very close, but not quite, to 0 or 1
Support for connected textures
  Requires texture files not currently passed by Mineways
  This will likely be an all-mineways addtion (no extra python scripting)
Clouds (2D and 3D)
  2D and 3D, Minexrafty and "real"
  Difficult to understand and write
    The way how light reflects off clouds in the real world is very complex
    The way how minecraft's clouds are formed shouldn't be too hard node-tree wise
  Will likely require changing geometry
Animated textures
  Defaults from Minecraft
  Grass, leaves, fire, and torches will need animations
  Difficult to structure
  Might require access to animated texture files which isn't currently provided
  Requires scripting of parts of the engine not yet explored (timeline)
Support for different weather types
  Difficult to understand and write
  Rain sources need to be placed somewhere, user might not like where it was placed by default
  Might require scripting of parts of the engine not yet explored (particles)
Better fire including embers, in the spirit of both Minecraft and real fire using the builtin engine
  Difficult to understand and write
    setting up fire in blender is overly complex node-tree wise at the moment; will requre lots of work
  Likely require changing geometry
  Requires scripting of parts of the engine not yet explored (particles, smoke(fire))
Better grass using inbuilt hair engine
  when the user scales their world model, the hair will not go with it
Importing other models (such as characters and mobs)
  Requires large amounts of information not currently passed by Mineways
  A lot of work on Mineways' end
